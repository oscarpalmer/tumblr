# Tumblr themes

Some of my old Tumblr themes _might_ end up here.

## Themes

All of my themes contain a lot of styling options, because I'm cool like that. There's also an option to enter your real name for a meta tag and the footer. It's all in the same place, so it shouldn't be that confusing.

Gauges, Mint, and Typekit support is also included. <i>(Please let me know which other services you would like to see being supported)</i>

- __Gauges__: You'll find the ID under "Tracking Code" on the dashboard.
- __Mint__: the link to the Mint installation is required.
- __Typekit__: You'll find the Typekit ID under "Embed Code" within the kit editor.
