# Hello!

Some of my old Tumblr themes _will_ end up here.

## Themes

All of my themes contain a lot of styling options, because I'm cool like that. There's also an option to enter your real name for a meta tag and the footer. It's all in the same place, so it shouldn't be that confusing.

### 05-12

This is pretty much the same theme as I am using right now. _(05/2012)_

Here's a [screenshot](http://d.opalmer.me/sEUm) of placeholder content and the default styling values.

## Licence

There's no licence, just say thanks and then do what you want with it.

If you do end up using one of my themes, please send a link so I can see it out in the wild. :)
